# Sudoku Solver ðŸŽ®   

## About the Project

This project is a fully functional 9 x 9 Sudoku game solver built entirely using vanilla JavaScript that uses an API to solve the Sudoku game

In this project I learned how to fetch and use APIs provided by [RapidAPI](https://github.com/RapidAPI)

## Project Demo

## Ideas for Future Updates
The project is still under development, and there are a number of features that I would like to add in the future. These features include:

- ```NodeJS``` : I would like to build the backend using Node.js to process all the API requests. This will allow me to securely hide the API key from the frontend and let everything happen from the server side in the backend.

## Contribute

No project is perfect, and there is always scope for improvement. I'm always looking for ways to make improvements to the project, so in case you find any bugs or if you have any suggestions for any new features, please feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/vishalsingh2972/JS-Sudoku-Solver/pulls) for review. 
I'd love to hear your ideas!
